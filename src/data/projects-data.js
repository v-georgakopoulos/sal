      "Fosforize was designed as a fully realized brand expressed through its space. From the initial idea to the final implementation, the goal was to create an authentic gathering spot with a clear identity and character.  ",
      "The project began with the naming process, a key strategic element of the branding, and continued with the definition of the concept and overall style. Architectural design, interior decoration, as well as the logo and visual identity were developed to ensure cohesion and functionality across all touchpoints of the brand. The development of Fosforize also included advisory guidance on product selection, operational flow, and the overall guest experience. Implementation was carried out by a team of specialized professionals under my continuous supervision, ensuring that every detail reflects the same philosophy and aesthetic.The concept draws inspiration from simplicity and the urban character of the city, blending urban, street, and avant-garde elements. Music and art play a central role in the identity of the space, while Greek meze and craft beers complete the experience. Fosforize is a 360° design example, where idea, brand, and space function as a unified whole, with clear direction and a distinct identity. "

The black and white palette enhances the brand’s elegant and high-end positioning, creating a visual system that feels confident, restrained, and enduring.Veyrale’s collections are curated with a focus on contemporary design and current fashion sensibilities, aligning the visual identity with a thoughtful and elevated approach to modern style.

      "With more than forty years of experience in the maritime industry, MSA is a well established Greek shipping agency with a strong operational background and international activity. Designing a new visual identity for a company of this scale required a careful balance between respecting its legacy and redefining how the brand presents itself today.",
      "In 2025, MSA decided to move forward with a complete refresh of its visual identity. The goal was to create a brand that could confidently stand on a global level and represent the company in international exhibitions and professional environments abroad. The new identity needed to feel modern, premium and internationally relevant, while maintaining a strong sense of reliability and professionalism. The redesigned logo is centered around a bold and distinctive lettermark. Expressive forms introduce a sense of movement and experience, while a clean typographic system provides clarity, precision and consistency across all applications. The visual language was developed to support a contemporary and global presence suited for a demanding B2B audience.",
      "The final result is a confident and modern brand identity that reflects MSA’s expertise and long standing experience in the maritime industry. The system was designed to work seamlessly across digital, print and large scale applications, positioning the company as a credible and premium presence in today’s international market. "
