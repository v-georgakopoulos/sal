    description:[
      "With more than forty years of experience in the maritime industry, MSA is a well established Greek shipping agency with a strong operational background and international activity. Designing a new visual identity for a company of this scale required a careful balance between respecting its legacy and redefining how the brand presents itself today.",
      "In 2025, MSA decided to move forward with a complete refresh of its visual identity. The goal was to create a brand that could confidently stand on a global level and represent the company in international exhibitions and professional environments abroad. The new identity needed to feel modern, premium and internationally relevant, while maintaining a strong sense of reliability and professionalism. The redesigned logo is centered around a bold and distinctive lettermark. Expressive forms introduce a sense of movement and experience, while a clean typographic system provides clarity, precision and consistency across all applications. The visual language was developed to support a contemporary and global presence suited for a demanding B2B audience.",
      "The final result is a confident and modern brand identity that reflects MSA’s expertise and long standing experience in the maritime industry. The system was designed to work seamlessly across digital, print and large scale applications, positioning the company as a credible and premium presence in today’s international market. "
